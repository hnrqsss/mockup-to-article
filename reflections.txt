Answers:

1. I alredy work with html and i knew most of tags used in this project, but i don't knew about the mockup,  my boss
   just tell what i should do and i try my best to do it. I will show this way to my workmates it is best and more fast
   to build a project this way.

2. It was easy i kwen most of the tags that i should use.

3. The only difficult part that the observation each part for the mockup with attention, for exemple i put one block
   surround with a paragraph tag  then i think "that it, i finish this part" but inside it contain a emphasis or a strong content that i did not sight, so i had to go back and put other tags inside this paragraph.
